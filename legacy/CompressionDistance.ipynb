Thus, communication between the illumination or light source controller and the imaging device, such as a surgical camera, is required. When the illumination or light source is turned off and the endoscope is outside the body, a sensor will detect ambient light alerting the illumination source controller that it is outside the body, which then keeps the illumination source off or at a low intensity level. Conversely, when the illumination source is turned off and the endoscope is inside the body, the sensor will not detect any light (or will detect only a very low level of light). Based on this logic, if the imaging device, such as a camera, knows that the light is off during a specific period of time the frame(s) from that time period can be analyzed and the level of light gathered in the frame(s) will show the scope location either inside or outside of the body.\"\n",

      "\"The sideframe and bolster of a railway car truck are constructed such that basic overall sideframe and bolster appearance is maintained, but the actual material it is constructed of is changed. The material used is changed from cast steel to an austempered metal, such as, cast austempered ductile iron; whereas cast iron has a density, 0.26 lbs/in^3, which is approximately 8% less than steel, 0.283 lbs/in^3. This immediately allows for a reduction in weight. A second benefit is that iron is easier to pour than steel and actually increases in volume, slightly, as metal cools compared to steel which shrinks. Efficient use of materials is improved, meaning less metal is used to make the same final shape, as a way of reducing the sideframe and bolster weight. Both factures combined allow for a lighter weight railway car truck, sideframe and bolster, while utilizing standard designs.\"\n",

Electric power produced by wave-power generation has been pointed out as being of low efficiency and more expensive than wind-power generation. To overcome the above problems, the present invention uses resonance and impedance matching of the sea waves, thus making it possible to markedly enhance the efficiency of wave-power generation. The present invention does not use a wave-height meter which is generally expensive and controls the generating apparatus in response to variation of the conditions of the sea, thus automatically maintaining the resonance and impedance matching operation, thereby making high-efficiency operation possible.

These three damping mechanisms can be optimized by modifying the wire material chemistries (metals, ceramics, polymers, etc.), wire sizes, wire shapes, wire coatings, wire bonding, and wire architecture (by removing certain wires).

The present invention utilizes a perturbation method to establish initial optimization strategies for an optimized variable setting curve. On this basis, self-learning iterative updating is carried out for mean values and standard differences on the basis of differences in data statistics, so that the continuous improvement of optimized indexes is realized, and thereby a new method is provided for batch process optimization strategies for solving actual industrial problems. The present invention is fully based on operational data of a production process, and does not need priori knowledge about a process mechanism and a mechanism model.
