      "     The invention refers to a thermo dynamic system able to capture heat from the surrounding environment and transform it in mechanical energy which is to be used partially for self functioning while the rest is saved for a consumer. The system can work with any heat source, but is also designed for very small temperature differences between the warm and the cold source, which makes it fit for working with non-conventional energy, especially solar energy. The system can be used to provide heat, mechanical energy or electrical energy to both small and large consumers. The system progressively increases this pressure using compressors with liquid, with refrigerant, isochoric-isobar compressors, compressors with atomizer, with constant volume, etc absorbing the heat from the environment it is placed in using receivers, bellow receivers, magnetized piston receivers, inline engine receivers, etc, and later transforming it in mechanical energy or even directly into electrical energy, through a pneumatic engine, a double gamma Stirling engine or through a special type of caged turbine capable of working with small enthalpy falls due to the large surface of the pallets. The pressure increase in the system can be also used to power a reversed cycle thermodynamic system, giving the possibility to obtain lower temperatures than the cold source's temperature or higher than the warm source's temperature. The pressure increase in the system's compressor is mainly obtained also through a thermal transfer in a compressor with constant volume. FIG.  20  presents a system to be setup on sea surface: the whole installation is setup on some support pillars  20   h,  using supports  20   i  which are sliding with the tides transforming this energy in the rotation of an electrical generator. Series of horizontal receivers are setup on this supports: warm receivers  20   j  or cold receivers  20   k  that can be also used as a platform for technical interventions, for focusing mirrors, for caged turbines, for pressurized refrigerant tanks and other equipments. Using mobile arms  20   m  on the water level cold receivers are placed  20   k,  with the horizontal axis tangent to a circle circumference having the center in the axis of the support pillar, while the hot receivers  20   j  can move around a vertical axis for orientation: one side perpendicular on the wind direction and the other sides parallel to it. This way a wind turbine is achieved. On top, due to the wave movement the vertical receivers have an oscillating movement that is transformed into energy using some pistons  20   e  actuated by the mobile arm. At their turn, the cold and warm receivers are elements of double-gamma Stirling engines, Stirling compressors, compressors with refrigerant, compressors with constant volume, counter flow sequential heat exchangers. All of them leading to increased enthalpy of the working agent and to its transformation into electrical energy in a caged turbine.\n",

One embodiment of this method of integrating solar energy into a regenerative Rankine power plant cycle, such as a coal power plant, allows for automatic balancing of the steam extraction flows and does not change the temperature of the feedwater to the boiler. The concept, depending on the application, allows for the spare turbine capacity normally available in a coal plant to be used to produce incremental capacity and energy that is powered by solar thermal energy.

The mounted resonator assembly is designed in such a way that it can be interfaced with a fluid delivery system to form a liquid tight chamber or flow cell around the mounted resonator without incurring additional physical impact upon the mounted resonator. The assembled flow cell can in turn be used to direct multiple fluid streams to flow in a laminar manner over the sensing surface of the mounted resonator and by varying the rates of flow for the different laminar flowing fluid streams the total hydraulic pressure exerted on the surface of the mounted resonator can be held constant.\n",

      "     Flat-sheet membrane filter assemblies require open space around equipment to form a viable path for an internal recycle or roll pattern. Creating a dedicated roll pattern for individual filter assemblies is space intensive and imposes process constraints on tank dimensions. A hollow wall or series of pipes forms a recycle wall designed to consolidate roll patterns and reduces space requirements. The recycle wall is designed such that the structural components also serve as a mixed liquor distribution system for the necessary roll pattern. Fixed vertically oriented conduit and sectional channel pieces allow for easy access and removal of membrane filter assemblies installed side by side. Feeding mixed liquor, air and or influent to the bottom of filter assemblies via submerged conduit improves process efficiency when coupled with return channels spaced not more than 10 feet away and above assemblies. The system is particularly advantageous for flat-sheet membrane filter units used in SMBR applications but is adaptable to other technologies including tubular and hollow-fiber membrane filter assemblies.\n",

Prior art only shows one pull tab on the top taking the cans too long to empty for consumers that desire their beverage to flow quicker and to avoid spraying their beverage potentially getting in to the eyes of consumers and destroying property such as clothes and furniture as it is widely known consumers puncture holes toward the bottom of the can to release the liquid quicker endangering themselves and others by spraying beverage and by the sharp objects used to make the holes in the cans. My new invention will improve safety for these types of consumers furthermore if the top tab breaks the bottom pull tab will allow the can to be opened. Additionally, a tomatoe juice can having two pull tabs on the top allows the thick juice to flow more rapidly. This also relieves having a sharp can opener to accomplish this task.\n",

With the powerful suction of the engine, the fluid on the upper surface of the outer shell is quickly sucked into the fluid channel via respective ports under conditions of long path, large area, high speed and low air pressure, which results in large lift from the interior of the aircraft. In the course of generating the lift, the fluid resistances of the fluid wall and the fluid hole are sucked into the fluid channel through the ports at the front and the surrounding area of the aircraft, then high-speed fluid is emitted from the rear port. This approach contributes greatly to the transformation of the existing aircraft.

      "     Described here is a detector for measuring heavy mass ions with high sensitivity and low saturation for time-of-flight mass spectrometry and a detector housing for selecting between multiple detectors. It relates to sensitive measuring methods of large masses in the range of about ten thousand to a few million atomic mass units. Specifically it relates to a conversion dynode in a specifically insolated geometry followed by a discrete dynode secondary electron multiplier specifically modified to decrease electron saturation and electronic ringing. Conversion dynode detectors have been used before for time-of-flight mass spectrometry and compared to direct detection with electron multipliers they exhibit superior sensitivity for high-mass, slow-moving macromolecular ions. Using a conversion dynode specifically insolated to a common ground plane has the added capabilities of allowing an increased voltage to be applied to the conversion dynode while maintaining a minimum distance between the conversion dynode and the front of the electron multiplier. This creates faster ion flight time for the secondary ions produced within the detector allowing for higher time resolution and sensitivity from the detector. Also, by adding capacitance as charge buffers to the last few electrodes of a discrete dynode electron multiplier used as a secondary electron multiplier, saturation can be greatly reduced or avoided, which is often a major problem when measuring samples with ions covering a broad mass range. The detector housing described allows multiple detectors to be selected without breaking the vacuum. By keeping all moving mechanical parts inside the vacuum, a more simple, robust and cost effective design can be realized which provides a platform for measuring ions using different detector designs.\n",

In addition, since there are few connections, fewer TIAs are required and differential stages are unnecessary. Power consumption is thus reduced, and, since the photodiode current is fed through one input to the TIA, fewer feedback resistors are required, thereby reducing thermal noise.

      "     Adequate heat dissipation is essential for semiconductor devices. When a device exceeds a specified junction temperature, the device can be damaged, not perform correctly, or can have a reduced operating life. Semiconductor packages must dissipate heat from the chip to the external environment (i.e. to the PCB, air, etc) to keep the semiconductor device below a certain temperature threshold. For most devices, the most efficient way to dissipate the heat is through the package external I/O connections and into the PCB that it is mounted to. For Ball Grid Array (BGA) packages, the external I/Os are solder balls. Variable pitch packages pose advantages in heat dissipation without introducing significant costs.\n",

      "     SOI MOSFETs are used for the transistors for switching of an antenna switch and yet harmonic distortion is significantly reduced. Capacitance elements are respectively added to either the respective drains or gates of the transistors comprising the through MOSFET group of reception branch of the antenna switch. This makes the voltage amplitude between source and gate and that between drain and gate different from each other. As a result, the voltage dependence of source-drain parasitic capacitance becomes asymmetric with respect to the polarity of voltage. This asymmetry property produces signal distortion having similar asymmetry property. Therefore, the following can be implemented by setting it so that it has the same amplitude as that of second-harmonic waves arising from the voltage dependence of substrate capacitance and a phase opposite to that of the same: second-order harmonic distortion can be canceled out and thus second-order harmonic distortion can be reduced.\n",

A relaxation voltage is applied to delay the onset of the high amplitude high frequency kick voltage when switching from a high tilt state to a low tilt state. The relaxation voltage allows the molecules to ‘relax’ in accordance with their own elasticity towards their low tilt state in the direction of the average azimuth angle of the low tilt state. Once the tilt angle has relaxed sufficiently, the kick voltage is applied to drive the molecules quickly to the low tilt state. Most unexpectedly, optimal switching time and the desired molecular response is achieved by delaying the onset of the large kick voltage via application of the relaxation voltage. The relaxation voltage may constitute a lower amplitude holding voltage, a small or zero DC voltage or a smooth windowing of the kick voltage. Whether to apply the relaxation voltage at all and how to apply the relaxation voltage for optimal switching are suitably controlled as a function of the high tilt state.

The defective elements can then be re-mapped to a redundant element at either the appropriate bit or column level based on the data. When a column is bad, but only on the bit level, the good bits can still be used for data, although this may be done at a penalty of under programming for some bits, as is described further below. A self contained Built In Self Test (BIST) flow constructed to collect the bit information through a set of column tests is also described. Based on this information, the bad bits can be extracted and re-grouped into bytes by the controller or on the memory to more efficiently use the column redundancy area.\n",

Recursive weights are also determined to be associated with the wavelet coefficients. An average multiscale bandlet coefficient associated with a wavelet coefficient for a current image is computed from this wavelet coefficient, the recursive weight associated therewith and a corresponding average multiscale bandlet coefficient computed for a previous image and associated with a wavelet coefficient offset according to the direction of regularity associated with the wavelet coefficient. The average multiscale bandlet coefficients can then be processed to produce an enhanced bandlet image to which an inverse wavelet transform is applied. The determination of a recursive weight associated with a wavelet coefficient for the current image comprises checking a condition between this wavelet coefficient and the corresponding average multiscale bandlet coefficient computed for the previous image, and updating a value of the recursive weight depending on the condition.\n",

      "     Disclosed is an image encoder that divides a digital image into a set of “macroblocks.” If appropriate, a macroblock is “downsampled” to a lower resolution. The lower-resolution macroblock is then encoded by applying spatial (and possibly temporal) prediction. The “residual” of the macroblock is calculated as the difference between the predicted and actual contents of the macroblock. The low-resolution residual is then either transmitted to an image decoder or stored for later use. In some embodiments, the encoder calculates the rate-distortion costs of encoding the original-resolution macroblock and the lower-resolution macroblock and then only encodes the lower-resolution macroblock if its cost is lower. When a decoder receives a lower-resolution residual, it recovers the lower-resolution macroblock using standard prediction techniques. Then, the macroblock is “upsampled” to its original resolution by interpolating the values left out by the encoder. The macroblocks are then joined to form the original digital image.\n",

The receiver includes a carrier frequency offset synchronizer having a carrier frequency offset detector, a frequency-locked loop having a controller. A transmitted signal having a carrier frequency is received by the receiver. A carrier frequency offset is estimated by comparing the carrier frequency of the transmitted signal and a reference frequency of a locally generated signal of the receiver. A plurality of parameters of the frequency-locked loop is determined to adjust the reference frequency to reduce the carrier frequency offset. Accordingly, the frequency-locked loop achieves frequency tracking of the OFDM signal.\n",

      "     Audio transducers (headphones, speakers, microphones) inherently do not accurately reproduce the signal presented to them at the input. This can be compensated for by taking into account the transducer characteristics and transforming the input signal using a digital signal processor (DSP) to counteract the inaccuracies. However, for the compensation to take place, the DSP needs to know the characteristics of the transducer. For systems with built-in transducers (like laptops with internal speakers) the characteristics of the internal speakers can be stored on the hard-drive of the laptop and the DSP can read this data and make the appropriate compensations. Because a transducer (headphone, speaker, microphone) has its own characteristics that need to be compensated for separately, a profile is supplied to the DSP either by a database lookup based on an identification made by the user or transducer itself or by profile information stored on the transducer. Once the characteristics of a transducer are known, many additional DSP algorithms can be applied in order to improve the audio performance and even safety of the system.\n",

The “residual” of the macroblock is calculated as the difference between the predicted content of the macroblock and the actual content of the macroblock. The residual is then “decimated” by taking an orderly subset of its values. The decimated residual is then either transmitted to an image decoder or is stored for later use. To recreate the original image, the macroblocks are first recreated from their received residuals. When a decimated residual is received, the values of the residual left out during decimation are interpolated from the values actually received. Using the prediction techniques along with the residual, the original content of the macroblock is recovered. The macroblocks are then joined to form the original digital image.\n",

      "     The disclosure generally involves an optical (perhaps flat panel) display utilizing backside reflection for time-multiplexed optical shuttering. One display comprises a side-illuminated light guide associated with conditions for total internal reflection. A first surface of the light guide is elastomeric. Disposed against this elastomeric surface is an active layer that selectively deforms the elastomeric surface in locations that can correspond to display pixels. This resulting change in the geometry of the elastomeric surface can be sufficient to defeat the conditions for total internal reflection. When appropriate, light is reflected by the particular deformation and is ejected from another surface of the light guide. In this case, each location that allows light to exit could represent an activated display pixel. In certain situations, color flat panel displays of varying sizes may further implement field sequential color and time-multiplexed optical shuttering.\n",

Urea ( 30 ), which decomposes at temperatures above 140 .degree. C., is injected ( 32 ) into a flue gas stream split off ( 28 ) after a heat exchanger ( 22 ), such as a primary superheater or an economizer. Ideally, the side stream would gasify the urea without need for further heating; but, when heat is required it is far less than would be needed to heat either the entire effluent ( 23 ) or the urea ( 30 ). This side stream, typically less than 3% of the flue gas, provides the required temperature and residence time for complete decomposition of urea ( 30 ). A cyclonic separator can be used to remove particulates and completely mix the reagent and flue gas. This stream can then be directed to an injection grid ( 37 ) ahead of SCR using a blower ( 36 ). The mixing with the flue gas is facilitated due to an order of magnitude higher mass of side stream compared to that injected through the AIG in a traditional ammonia-SCR process.\n",

A hybrid protein encoded by the LacZ-TTC gene fusion retains the biological functions of both proteins in vivo, i.e. retrograde transynaptic transport of the TTC fragment and βgal enzymatic activity. After intramuscular injection, enzymatic activity can be detected in motoneurons and connected neurons of brainstem areas. This strategy is useful for the delivery of a biological activity to neurons from the periphery to the central nervous system. Such a hybrid protein can also be used to map synaptic connections between neural cells.\n",

An amount of the SCDCC is introduced into the patient sufficient to induce the patient's immune system to produce antibodies which inhibit or destroy the patient's cancer cells. The SCDCC may also be genetically modified to produce various immune stimulating proteins which enhance the patient's immune response to the cancer cells and improves the efficacy of the SCDNIC in treating the patient's cancer.\n",

      "     Often used to reduce the RC delay in integrated circuits are dielectric films of porous organosilicates which have a silica like backbone with alkyl or aryl groups (to add hydrophobicity to the materials and create free volume) attached directly to the Si atoms in the network. Si—R bonds rarely survive an exposure to plasmas or chemical treatments commonly used in processing; this is especially the case in materials with an open cell pore structure. When Si—R bonds are broken, the materials lose hydrophobicity, due to formation of hydrophilic silanols and low dielectric constant is compromised. A method by which the hydrophobicity of the materials is recovered using a novel class of silylation agents which may have the general formula (R 2 N) X SiR′ Y  where X and Y are integers from 1 to 3 and 3 to 1 respectively, and where R and R′ are selected from the group of hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, allyl and a vinyl moiety.
